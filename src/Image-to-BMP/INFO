A simple C++ image class with not much going for it 
except for the fact that it can write its contents 
to a BMP file. Useful if you are writing a CPU ray 
tracer or any other program that writes to a buffer
and you don't want to muck about with GLUT, VTK or 
the like.

    [Shortcommings]

Cannot handle images whose width is not divisible 
by 4. Then again, I might have patched that problem,
I cannot recall.
